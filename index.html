        Japan, the world's third largest economy, continues to face the problem of declining birth rates and a rapidly aging population. One of the key reasons is Japan's mental health crisis in the form of its loneliness epidemic. This seems to be a striking contradiction given that Japan, a nation that values collectivism, is one of the world's loneliest countries. In fact, a 2019 study by Legatum Institute reported that Japan is ranked 132nd out of 167 countries in terms of social capital, meaning that the Japanese have few trusted social networks <a href="https://li.com/reports/2019-legatum-prosperity-index/" target="_blank">(Brien, 2019)</a>.

      <p>
        This loneliness epidemic was also exacerbated by the extended isolation periods brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly 40% of Japanese feeling lonely. Of the 3,011 respondents, the majority were in their 20s at 42.7%, followed by those in their 30s and 40s, at 41.6% and 40.5% <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/03/19/national/social-issues/loneliness-survey-pandemic/" target="_blank">(Nearly 40% of People Feel Lonely in Japan, 2022)</a>. This points to the fact that loneliness is present and has serious consequences across all age groups in Japan—both young and old.

      <p>
        Japan's loneliness epidemic has been a growing problem that has been plaguing the country for decades. After World War 2, Japanese culture had a norm: work had to be the most important thing to a family in order to achieve a professional life <a href="https://www.anewseducation.com/post/japan-loneliness-issue" target="_blank">(Khan, 2021)</a>. This resulted in many workers, most of which were men, to pursue their career over their family and friends. Despite this societal norm being very common during post-war Japan, the poor economy still resulted in Japanese workers being pushed to smaller jobs, and in some cases, being forced into early retirement. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite all of that, it is also argued that this Japanese norm was actually beneficial to Japan as their economy boomed. However, with this high speed of growth, came the straining of traditional family bonds <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1007/s43545-021-00169-8" target="_blank">(Touyama, Poudal, 2021)</a>. One evidence of this would be the creation of mass housing estates, which at the present, 1/3 of these estates are only occupied by a single person. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, came the Lost Decade of Japan. This occurred during the 1990s and is called the Lost Decade due to the economic recession that hit Japan. As a result, many people, particularly males, were either forced to work long hours or not have work at all, therefore being unable to provide for their families <a href="https://www.anewseducation.com/post/japan-loneliness-issue" target="_blank">(Khan, 2021)</a>. Moreover, many students were also forced to work jobs that did not have adequate pay and no contractual guarantee. The work conditions did not fare any better. Many workers and student-workers were forced to work overtime and were underappreciated and they were oftentimes bullied in the workplace. As a result, these workers isolated themselves from society, eventually resulting in the creation of the Hikikomori phenomenon, where Japanese workers hide themselves from society.

      <script type="text/javascript" src="js/weekly-hours-chart.js"></script>

      <p>
        Dating back to as early as the 1990s, one attribute that is brought up as a cause to Japan's loneliness epidemic would be the hours worked of Japanese workers. According to a survey made by the Statistics Bureau of Japan, Regular male and female employees would work at an average of 47.9 hours and 38.9 hours a week respectively, both of which are over the global average of 35 hours per week. This also, is the same case for directorial positions, as male and female directors who employ workers would work at an average of 50.4 and 42.7 hours, respectively <a href="https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kokusei/2000/kihon2/00/04.html#:~:\text=Average%20weekly%20working%20hours%3A%2046.7,and%2036.3%20hours%20for%20females." target="_blank">(Statistics Bureau of Japan, 2000)</a>.

    <div class = "section" id = "social-expectations">
      <h2>Social Pressures</h2>

      <p>
        However, it is important to note that Japan's collectivist culture is actually what drives these factors: the demanding work culture established by the post-war modernization and the psychological effects of the lost decade—all of which gave rise to Japan's loneliness epidemic. Because of the country's collectivist culture, there is a huge socio-psychological pressure to conform to the norm. This pressure is mostly due to their fear of being excluded or ostracized from society, a term known as murahachibu in Japanese <a href="https://sunwayechomedia.com/2021/10/29/demystifying-hikikomori-the-hermits-of-modern-day-japan/" target="_blank">(Jing, 2021)</a>. This shame-based ostracism was widely-practiced during the Edo period (1603-1868) where villagers voted to exclude those who failed to conform to the social norms <a href="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/history-of-emotions/blog-feeling-news/behind-the-mask-in-japan" target="_blank">(Toyota, 2020)</a>. This fear transforms into a variety of social expectations at home, in the workplace, and in society. There is pressure to excel, with strong emphasis on making yourself a contributing member of society. When they can't meet these expectations, they themselves feel “worthless,” and they are also subjected to shame by others.

      </div>

      <p>
        Another element of Japan's collectivist culture that fosters loneliness in society is how the Japanese view reliance on others and failure to address problems independently as taboo and causing trouble for others <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/d00763/" target="_blank">(Mitsunori, 2021)</a>. Hence, people prioritize the needs of those around them over their own, for the sake of keeping the spirit of “harmony.” However, this shame surrounding reliance on others is also what drives the reluctance of the Japanese to accept government support. Some Japanese believe that a social welfare system burdens taxpayers to assist people who are unwilling to make the effort to support themselves. This results in many refusing welfare due to instances of criticism or bullying, as they are viewed as a nuisance to society <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/d00763/" target="_blank">(Mitsunori, 2021)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These events in Japan's history and elements in Japan's collectivist culture all contribute to serious consequences of its loneliness epidemic which are the rising numbers of hikikomori and kodokushi, and the declining birth rates.

    <div class = "section" id = "hikikomori">
      <h2>The Hikikomori Epidemic</h2>
      <p>
        Hikikomori refers to the complete withdrawal of Japanese people from society. The Japanese Ministry of Health defines this as individuals who refuse to leave their homes to go to work or school for a period of at least 6 months <a href="https://www.anewseducation.com/post/japan-loneliness-issue" target="_blank">(Khan, 2021)</a>. A nationwide Cabinet Office survey in 2019 found that there are over 1 million hikikomori in Japan, where the majority are middle-aged, with 613,000 in the 40-54 age group, and 541,000 in the 15-39 age group.
      </p>

      <div class = "hikikomori-pie-container">

      </div>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="js/hikikomori-pie.js"></script>

      <p>
        Once someone enters the “hikikomori system” for a long period of time, they get trapped into a vicious cycle. When a hikikomori isolates, they lose social connections. Due to the social stigma, these individuals and their families are subjected to shame, which in turn, makes their family also gradually detach from society. This leads to the “80-50 problem” where elderly parents live with their hikikomori children, isolated from the rest of society <a href="https://sunwayechomedia.com/2021/10/29/demystifying-hikikomori-the-hermits-of-modern-day-japan/" target="_blank">(Jing, 2021)</a>.

    <div class = "section" id = "romance">
      <h2>Losing the Romance</h2>

      <p>
        Aside from social isolation, loneliness in Japan also manifests itself as an avoidance of romantic relationships such as dating and marriage. In particular, the Japanese not marrying directly contributes to the low birth rate in Japan. Since the turn of he century and the end of the Lost Decade, the average age of marriage has increased from 28.8 to 31 for men and from 27 to 29.4 for women. Of those who get married, they get married a little over 2 years later.
      </p>

      <div class = "age-chart-container">
        <canvas id="age-chart" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
      </div>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="js/marriage-age-chart.js"></script>

      <p>
        That is, of course, for the Japanese who marry in the first place. A much more concerning statistic is the percentage age of those in their 50s who have never married. Japan keeps track of this statistic because of the assumption that those who have not married by age 50 have an incredibly low probability of actually getting married. Unlike the increase in average marrying age, which while consistent is not that high, the number of Japanese age 50 who have never married has more than quintupled for men from 5.6% to 26.7% and more than quadrupled for women from 4.3% to 17.5% since the end of the lost decade.

      </div>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="js/never-marry-chart.js"></script>

      <p>
        The weak performance of the Japanese economomy has made the romantic lives of men significantly more barren, considering that men have the role of breadwinner in traditional Japanese culture. This is reinforced in a research by <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0241571" target="_blank">Ueda (2020)</a>, where they discovered that lower income is strongly correlated with the probability of being single. Consequently, married men were most likely to have the highest incomes. 32.2% of Japanese men who were married had a salary of at least 5 million yen, contrary to only 11% of men who were not in any romantic relationship. Intuitively, economic hardships make it difficult to commit to a romantic relationship

      <p>
        Kodokushi refers to the phenomena of “lonely deaths,” which occurs primarily among the elderly who live and die alone, without being discovered for long periods of time. A hikikomori lifestyle, according to psychologist Yuichi Hattori, could lead to a rise in kodokushi-style deaths. Hattori observes that when people have no strong social connections, they may retreat inside out of shame, never seeking the aid they need. People withdraw from society and die alone as a result of the cycle, especially if they outlive their parents and become elderly themselves <a href="https://www.anewseducation.com/post/japan-loneliness-issue" target="_blank">(Khan, 2021)</a>.

              Last February 12, 2021, in hopes of implementing measures that will prevent social isolation and depression in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Japanese government appointed their 1st minister of Loneliness. Cabinet member Tetsushi Sakamoto would go on to serve as the 1st Minister of Loneliness.

              Last 2020, the Japanese government conducted a nationwide census for their citizens as an initiative to counter COVID-19. Additionally, this nationwide census also took into account the Japanese population which were lonely due to the social isolation brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

              The Japanese government also conducted many forums that talked about ideas such as mental health amidst a pandemic and the history of their growing loneliness epidemic. One example would be the Prime Minister forum that occured last February 25,2021. In this forum Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga addressed concerns such as preventing loneliness and isolation, understanding anxiety and creating connections.

              In Japan, one initiative that the community has created in hopes of fighting back against their loneliness epidemic would be the Rent a Family system. In this system, it is possible to rent out a family, whether it be for one simple dinner or one whole day. This service has been around Japan for as early as the 1990s. One of the main selling points of this service system is that it can serve as a band-aid solution to loneliness caused by isolation.

One example of a website would be Puchi-kano, where they allow you to rent a girlfriend for a day, allowing you to take her on a date just like a normal couple would. According to an interview, one of the motivations in creating these rent a girlfriend sites is that it hopes to decrease the number of teenage hikikomori.

According to a research that was conducted by Tiefenbach, there was a strong correlation between participation in a Japanese Neighborhood Association and a person's happiness level. In fact, it was also found that loneliness was the main reason on why Japanese people would participate in their Neighborhood Association.

        It is not all negative news for Japan. The Initiatives by both the government and the community in the last decade have decreased various factors contributing to loneliness such as overtime and work hours in general, and those resulting from loneliness such as suicides, mental illness, among others. While birth rate and the economic effects of loneliness still continues towards an unwelcome trend, the collective Japanese people are experiencing a healing in mental health.
